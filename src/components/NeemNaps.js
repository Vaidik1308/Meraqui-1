          NAPS is a scheme launched by the Government of India to promote apprenticeship. Apprenticeship Training consists of Basic Training and On-The-Job Training at the workplace in the industry. Meraqui helps to promote apprenticeship training and increase the engagement of apprentices so that they could later join the mainstream workforce.

          <br></br>
          It has been observed that organizations face issues like charting annual apprenticeship plans, mobilization of eligible candidates under designated and optional trades, determining the applicability of Basic Training, and registering or aligning Basic Training Providers.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          To simplify and facilitate this process, MSDE has authorized outsourcing the activities like mobilization of candidates, registration, basic training, and other related administrative activities to third parties.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          After outsourcing these activities, organizations can concentrate more on their core function and need not engage additional manpower for these activities
